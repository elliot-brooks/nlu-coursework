Coursework implementing pairwise classification task of Authorship Verification

## How to train the models
**Relevant files**
- `src/av_model_one.ipynb`
- `src/av_model_two.ipynb`
- `data/training_data.zip`

Open the notebooks in `Google Colab` as well as the training (zip files will need extracting)

`Run the notebooks`

### Saving the models
---
**Relevant files**
- `models/MODEL_PATH_HERE`
- `models/MODEL_PATH_HERE`

Both notebooks that train the model will produce a file that can be loaded into the demo code.

Save this file `locally` in `models` and then push to git

## Evaluating the models
**Relevant files**
- `models/MODEL_PATH_HERE`
- `models/MODEL_PATH_HERE`
- `data/trail_data.zip`

Open the notebook `evaluate_models_dev.ipynb` in google colab and import both model files and the dev data set

`Run the notebook`

## Running the demo code
**Relevant files**
- `models/MODEL_PATH_HERE`
- `models/MODEL_PATH_HERE`
- `demo_code.ipynb`

Provide the path for the `test data` where indicated and import both model files

`Run the notebook`
